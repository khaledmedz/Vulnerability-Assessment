# Vulnerability Assessment Report - May 1, 2023

Welcome to the Vulnerability Assessment Report for May 1, 2023. This report delves into the security aspects of our system, providing insights into our system description, scope, purpose, risk assessment, approach, and remediation strategies.

## System Description

Our server is equipped with a robust CPU processor and boasts 128GB of memory. It operates on the latest Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. Secure communication is ensured through SSL/TLS encrypted connections. The server interacts with other networked servers using IPv4 addresses.

## Scope

This report scrutinizes the current access controls of our system over a three-month period from June 2022 to August 2022. We've closely followed NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidelines to guide our risk analysis.

## Purpose

Our database server plays a pivotal role as the central hub for storing and managing substantial data. It holds crucial information about customers, marketing campaigns, and analytics, enabling us to track performance and tailor marketing strategies. Securing this system is paramount, given its integral role in day-to-day marketing operations.

## Risk Assessment

We've assessed various risks based on potential threats, their likelihood, and severity. The table below summarizes these risks:

| Threat Source | Threat Event                     | Likelihood | Severity | Risk  |
| --------------|----------------------------------|------------|----------|-------|
| Hacker        | Data Theft                        | Moderate   | Moderate | High  |
| Employee      | Disruption of Operations          | Low        | Moderate | Moderate  |
| Customer      | Data Alteration or Deletion       | Very Low   | Moderate | Low   |

## Approach

Our assessment considered data storage and management procedures, potential threat sources, and events. We evaluated the likelihood of security incidents given the system's open access permissions. We also weighed the severity of potential incidents against their impact on daily operational needs.

## Remediation Strategy

To enhance security, we have devised a comprehensive remediation strategy, including:

- Implementation of strong authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the database server.
- The use of strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges.
- Adoption of TLS for data encryption while in transit.
- Restricting access to the database server via IP allow-listing, primarily for corporate offices, to prevent random internet users from connecting.
